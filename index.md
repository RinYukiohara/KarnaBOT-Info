# FAQ

## What happens when Karna Bot messages twice?

Please do not be alarmed when you see this, it just means that both my computer and Heroku are running the bot.

# Note

This is somehow an issue I need to address. Karna BOT is a discord bot; he has no connections to the FGO game and won’t make your luck any better. He is a simulation of the FGO roll system, not a modifier of the game.
