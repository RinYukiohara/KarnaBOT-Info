# Updates

Updates can be seen when typing k!help.

# Tales of

As a thanks to the help from the Tales of Crestoria community, there are 20 servants who originate from the Tales games. These servants are a permanent part of the servant gacha pools.

# Multi Roll

I have not yet found a solution to the delay in messages since it sends each servant in a single message. I have tried to use embeds and code blocks but the for loop makes it extremely difficult to do anything. For now, the best thing to do is wait for the ten servants to be listed before messaging again. 

# FAQ

## Can I invite Karna BOT?

I get this question asked a bunch on Instagram and Facebook, and the answer is no. This is because I want to monitor his activity and respond immediately to any problems that arise.

## Where can I play with Karna BOT?

You will have to be a member of a server I am in. I won’t give out any invites since I don’t want to get in trouble for advertising when I’m not supposed to, so please just be patient.

## What happens when Karna Bot messages twice?

Please do not be alarmed when you see this, it just means that both my computer and Heroku are running the bot.

# Note

This is somehow an issue I need to address. Karna BOT is a discord bot; he has no connections to the FGO game and won’t make your luck any better. He is a simulation of the FGO roll system, not a modifier of the game.
