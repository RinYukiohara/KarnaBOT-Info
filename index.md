## Update

# Multi Roll

I am still working on the multi roll feature, and with help from friends, it should be done by the end of this month. I am using embeds which should help will visual aesthetics. 

# Single Roll

The single roll unfortunately will not be following the same path as the multi roll with using embeds as I am using local images from my files. It is still functional and may be updated to have embeds in the future.

# Tickets and Games

This is still in the planning stage and has not been worked at beyond a single message. It will be in development once the multi roll feature has been completed and checked over by beta testers.

## FAQ

# Can I invite Karna BOT?

I get this question asked a bunch on Instagram and Facebook, and the answer is no. This is because I want to monitor his activity and respond immediately to any problems that arise.

# Where can I play with Karna BOT?

You will have to be a member of a server I am in. I won’t give out any invites since I don’t want to get in trouble for advertising when I’m not supposed to, so please just be patient.

## Notes

This is somehow an issue I need to address. Karna BOT is a discord bot; he has no connections to the FGO game and won’t make your luck any better. He is a simulation of the FGO roll system, not a modifier of the game.
