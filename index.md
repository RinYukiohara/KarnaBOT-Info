# Updates

## Multi Roll

The multi roll feature is under maintenance, with the help of the Tales of Crestoria discord server, it should be done soon. 

## Tickets and Games

Only the ticket function is being implemented, you can now roll for a guaranteed 5* or 6* if you’re lucky.

## Tales of Series

Thanks to the help of the Tales of Crestoria community, 20 new servants have been added to the single roll pool, all coming from the Tales series. 

# FAQ

## Can I invite Karna BOT?

I get this question asked a bunch on Instagram and Facebook, and the answer is no. This is because I want to monitor his activity and respond immediately to any problems that arise.

## Where can I play with Karna BOT?

You will have to be a member of a server I am in. I won’t give out any invites since I don’t want to get in trouble for advertising when I’m not supposed to, so please just be patient.

## What happens when Karna Bot messages twice?

Please do not be alarmed when you see this, it just means that both my computer and the Heroku are running the bot.

# Notes

This is somehow an issue I need to address. Karna BOT is a discord bot; he has no connections to the FGO game and won’t make your luck any better. He is a simulation of the FGO roll system, not a modifier of the game.
